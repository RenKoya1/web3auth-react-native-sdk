# Web3Auth React Native SDK

Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

## ‚è™ Requirements

- For iOS, only iOS 12+ supported since we requires ASWebAuthenticationSession.

- For Android, Custom Tab support is required.

## Selecting your Workflow

In React Native, you have the choice to use one of the following workflows:

- **Bare Workflow**: Your React Native app is entirely built on your own machine. You can customize your app with Swift/Kotlin native modules.
- **Expo Managed Workflow**: Your React Native Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app.

## ‚ö° Installation

```sh
npm install @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

## üåü Configuration

### Configure your Web3Auth project

Hop on to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

![Web3Auth Dashboard](https://web3auth.io/docs/assets/images/project_plug_n_play-89c39ec42ad993107bb2485b1ce64b89.png)

- Add `{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}://auth` to **Whitelist URLs**.

- Copy the Project ID for usage later.

### Expo Managed Workflow

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow, you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser` implementation.)

```sh
expo install expo-web-browser
```

To allow the SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to place a designated scheme into `app.json`, like below:

```js
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "web3authexposample"
  }
}
```

### Bare workflow Configuration

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us.

```sh
npm install --save @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

#### Android

- The `scheme` parameter in the `redirectUrl` is specificable, and has to be added into the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<data android:scheme="web3authrnexample" />
```

#### iOS

- The `scheme` parameter in the `redirectUrl` is specificable here as well, however, it does not need to be added as a iOS Custom URL Scheme. You may add the `scheme` to your iOS `Info.plist`, but it is not required.

#### Register the URL scheme you intended to use for redirection

- In the Web3Auth Developer Dashboard, add the URL scheme you intended to use for redirection to the **Whitelist URLs** section.

For example, the scheme mentioned is `web3authrnexample` and the `redirectUrl` mentioned is `${scheme}://openlogin`, we will whitelist:

```
web3authrnexample://openlogin
```

## üí• Initialization & Usage

In your sign-in activity', create an `Web3Auth` instance with your Web3Auth project's configurations and 
configure it like this:

### Expo Managed Workflow

```js
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, {
    clientId,
    network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.TESTNET, // or other networks
});
const info = await web3auth.login({
    loginProvider: LOGIN_PROVIDER.GOOGLE,
    redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
    mfaLevel: 'mandatory', // optional
    curve: 'secp256k1', // optional
});
```

### Bare Workflow

```js
import * as WebBrowser from '@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser';
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, {
    clientId,
    network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.TESTNET, // or other networks
});
const info = await web3auth.login({
    loginProvider: LOGIN_PROVIDER.GOOGLE,
    redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
    mfaLevel: 'mandatory', // optional
    curve: 'secp256k1', // optional
});
```
